      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <img src="images/ct_photo1.png" alt="" />
      <p><strong>Curbside Thai</strong> brings the rich flavor of Thailand to
      North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35
      years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers
      that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte
      with our modern mobile food truck.</p>

     <p>This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy
     paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various
     mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from
     11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and
     11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the
     difference! If you can't get away from your desk,
     <em>Curbside Thai will deliver</em>.</p>

     <p>Contact us to cater your next party and experience
     what <cite>Carolina Traveler</cite> calls <q>the finest Asian food
     on or off the streets of Charlotte</q>.</p>

       <h1>Reviews</h1>
       <blockquote>
         The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily
         improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from
         Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai.
         Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious
         and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think
         Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off
         the streets of Charlotte.

       <blockquote>
         Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare
         and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the
         convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you
         don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a
         master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast,
         Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the
         Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.
